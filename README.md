# YAFS (Yet Another Fog Simulator) for Predictive Maintenance

This project uses YAFS (Yet Another Fog Simulator), a Python-based simulator for Fog Computing scenarios, to simulate a predictive maintenance system. The system predicts potential equipment failures and schedules maintenance before the failure occurs.

## Features

- Simulation of a network of IoT devices reporting equipment status.
- Predictive algorithms to forecast equipment failures.
- Scheduling of maintenance tasks based on predictions.

## Prerequisites

Before running the simulation, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python: [Installation Guide](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- YAFS: Install with pip `pip install yafs`

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/YAFS-Predictive-Maintenance.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd YAFS-Predictive-Maintenance
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Run the simulation:

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

## Usage

- The simulation creates a network of IoT devices reporting equipment status.
- Predictive algorithms analyze the status reports to forecast potential equipment failures.
- Based on the predictions, the system schedules maintenance tasks to prevent equipment failure.
